This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

### Password gate (production)

Protection is **fail-closed**: middleware always runs for matched routes. Without a valid **`portfolio_site_access`** cookie, requests are redirected to **`/login`**. If **`SITE_PASSWORD`** is missing in Vercel, nobody can complete login until you set it — the homepage is still not public.

1. Vercel → your project → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add **`SITE_PASSWORD`** (and optionally **`SITE_ACCESS_SECRET`**) for **Production** (and **Preview** if needed)
3. **Redeploy**

Check `GET /api/site-access` — `gateConfigured: true` means login can succeed. Responses from middleware include **`X-Site-Gate-Middleware: 1`** and **`X-Site-Gate-Action`**: `public` | `allow` | `redirect`. Set **`SITE_GATE_DEBUG=1`** in Vercel to log `[site-gate]` lines in the deployment’s **Functions** logs.
